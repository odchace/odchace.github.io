        <p>Recently, I've decided to learn computer science concepts in a more structured way than I'd been doing thus far. I did take a few CS courses in college, and even used Python in my undergrad capstone project. But as I've more recently tried out websites like codewars or leetcode, it's become clear that some of that knowledge has faded - most notably my memory and understanding of certain common algorithms. There are also topics that I <em>never</em> had to delve too deeply into in the first place, as a math major - particularly best practices to minimize space and/or time complexity. </p>
        <p>While searching for good free resources to help me shore up these gaps in knowledge - and perhaps other important gaps that I'm unaware of - I discovered <a href='https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides'>this guide</a>. Which is how I wound up making this blog, as part of Khan Academy's Intro to HTML/CSS course. I initially thought I would likely skip over some of this early material, since I'm already familiar with the basic high-level concepts found here. But after trying the first few projects in the intro to JS course, I decided to stick around. I had never previously used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, or done anything related to web design. And my only experiences with "animation" were from my Freshman Intro to CS course: a couple basic projects where I spent more time struggling against the language (which was, <strong>tragically</strong>, Racket). So, I decided that these courses are worthwhile after all.</p>
